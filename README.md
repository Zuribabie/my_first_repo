In this project, you are required to build your own CV website using the format above. Replace the images and content with your own information. Don’t be afraid if you struggle and mess a few things up, you’re still learning!

Feel free to use the forum if you have any challenges or reach out to your mentor for guidance.

When you are done, please follow the instructions in the next lesson on how to use Git & GitHub to upload your code for review.
